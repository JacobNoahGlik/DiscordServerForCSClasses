# Custom Invite Auto-Role Guide

## Step-By-Step Guide
1. Add the `BetterInvites` Discord bot to your server
2. Generate multiple invites - you will need one invite per group.
    1. Example: 
        1. Group 1: Students (one invite link)
        2. Group 2: TAs (diferent invite link)
      
    2. You can create multiple distinct invite links by hitting the `create invite button` on the side of diferent text channels
3. Run the command: `/createinvite` this will prompt you to select one of the many invite links you've created. Select a link that has not yet been selected by the bot and assign roles for a group. Now send this link to members of that group.
    1. Example:
        1. Group 1: Students (Link: `https://discord.gg/abcdefg`) (roles: `@student`, `@member`)
        2. Group 2: TAs (Link: `https://discord.gg/12345`) (roles: `@Teaching Staff`, `@TA`, `@member`)
    2. Now send the link `https://discord.gg/abcdefg` to students and the link `https://discord.gg/12345` to TAs
4. Varify that the roles are assigned correctly by running `/display`. Note the response is only visable to you.
