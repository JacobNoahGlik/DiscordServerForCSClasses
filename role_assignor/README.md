# Role Assignor

## TO RUN:

###### PLEASE NOTE: run in a terminal and quickly alt+tab to discord server channel (you have 3 seconds), so you should get everything ready before running the command:

```bash
py main.py [FILENAME: "major_roles.txt", "programming_roles.txt", "year_roles.txt"]
```

###### If running multiple files at once, do not use commas. Ex: `py main.py major_roles.txt programming_roles.txt year_roles.txt`
###### It's recommended to run the code in a `bot-spam` channel so users don't see this backend stuff

## PREREQUISITES

You must have [carl-bot](https://carl.gg/) installed on this server, and it must have admin permissions on both the channel you are sending these messages in and the `#roles` channel also

You must have `pyautogui` installed (`pip install pyautogui`)
