# Role Assignor

## TO RUN:

###### PLEASE NOTE: run in a terminal and quickly alt+tab to discord server chanel (you have 3 seconds) so you should get everything ready before running the command:

```bash
py main.py [FILENAME: "major_roles.txt", "programming_roles.txt", "year_roles.txt"]
```

###### It's reccomended to run the code in a `bot-spam` chanel so users don't see this backend stuff

## PREREQUISITES

You must have [carl-bot](https://carl.gg/) installed on this server and it must have admin permisions on both the chanel you are sending these messages in, and the `#roles` chanel also
