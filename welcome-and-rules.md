🎉 Welcome to the <PROFESSOR'S NAME HERE> <COURSE NAME HERE> Discord Server! 🎉

👋  Whether you're a seasoned coder or just dipping your toes into the world of algorithms, we're thrilled to have you here. :index_pointing_at_the_viewer:🥳 

👥 Assigning Roles:
First, head over to the ⁠roles chat and give `Carl-Bot` a little reaction to snag your academic year, major, or any other roles you fancy.

:shaking_face: Need a helping hand with your latest assignment or concept? Don't sweat it! Your SAs and TAs are here for you! Pop into the ⁠#upcoming-office-hours chat for all the deets on when and where you can catch us. Can't make it to office hours? No worries! Shoot us a message, and we or your peers will do our best to assist you.

🤝 Collaborative Learning:
We get it—sometimes you just need to bounce ideas off a fellow student. That's what this server is all about! Collaboration is key, but remember, cheating is a big no-no. Avoid giving away complete solutions to your peers. We want you to learn and grow in your understanding. (and the ability to google!) 🔎 

🙏 Respect and Inclusivity:
Mutual respect is paramount in our community. Treat each other with kindness, understanding, and empathy. We're all in this together, so let's make this space one where everyone feels welcome and valued.

🚀 Enjoy Your Stay:
Let's conquer algorithms together! 💪👩‍💻👨‍💻
