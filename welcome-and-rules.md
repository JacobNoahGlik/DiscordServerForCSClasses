🎉 Welcome to the Engling Algorithms Discord Server! 🎉

👋  Whether you're a seasoned coder or just dipping your toes into the world of algorithms, we're thrilled to have you here. 🫵 🥳 

👥 Assigning Roles:
First things first, head over to the ⁠roles chat and give Carlbot a little react to snag your academic year, major, or any other roles you fancy.

🫨  Need a helping hand with your latest assignment or concept? Don't sweat it! Your SAs and TAs are here for you! Pop into the ⁠upcoming-office-hours chat for all the deets on when and where you can catch us. Can't make it to office hours? No worries!

🤝 Collaborative Learning:
We get it—sometimes you just need to bounce ideas off a fellow student. That's what this server is all about! Collaboration is key, but remember, cheating is a big no-no. Avoid giving away complete solutions to your peers. We want you to learn and grow in your understanding. (and the ability to google!) 🔎
